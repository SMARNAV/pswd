A very simple password generator in python

username (if any) + '#' + Input highest-level site-domain without uri as $1

for example,

https://login.example.com becomes example.com therefore enter="email@example.com#example.com"

ftp://another.example.co.uk becomes example.co.uk therefore enter="username#example.co.uk"

because otherwise all sites with second level tlds would be that tld
